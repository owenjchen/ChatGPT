# GPT-4, Bard, Claude, GitHub Copilot and other ChatGPT alternatives

- [Bard by Google](https://bard.google.com/)

Bard is Google's answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT. It is a large language model trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.

Here are some of Bard's capabilities:

- answer questions in an informative way, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange.

- generate different creative text formats of text content, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.

- translate languages.
I can write different kinds of creative content.
I can help you with programming and software development tasks, including code generation, debugging and code explanation.
I can assist with writing functions for Google Sheets.
I can explain code snippets.
I can simplify complex topics.
I can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity.

- [Claude by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/product)

Currently there are two Claude LLMs:

- Claude-instant tends to be better at many creative writing tasks and tends to give longer and more in-depth answers. Compared to the previously available Claude, Claude-instant is faster and significantly better at non-English languages.

- Claude+ is significantly better than Claude-instant at complex and difficult tasks. Similar to Claude-Instant, it is particularly strong at creative writing and providing detailed responses.
Sage and ChatGPT tend to be better at languages other than English, and are better at programming-related tasks.


NeevaAI cites sources and includes up to date information in its replies. It is a much easier way to get a synthesized answer from an internet search. Note that it is different from other bots on Poe in that it doesnâ€™t support multiple back-and-forth exchanges or creative writing. It is great for factual, up-to-date, digestible answers with sources.

Dragonfly tends to have shorter responses, and it can be easier to get Dragonfly to follow instructions when given examples in the input.

GPT-4 is a major advance relative to ChatGPT and is the most powerful language model available to the world today. It is particularly strong at creative writing, problem solving (e.g. math and physics), and instruction following.
